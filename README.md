# InsertionSort
This is a C# implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm.
The program runs on .NET 6.0.

** Steps in insertion sort: **
 1. For each element from the 2nd to the last (I'll call each of them 'n'). Run through each element before n to see if n is smaller (or larger) than that element.
 2. If so, swap the elements. Continue doing this until reaching an element that is smaller (or larger) than n.
